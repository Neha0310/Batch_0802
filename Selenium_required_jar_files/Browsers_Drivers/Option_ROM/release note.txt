v0.96    a. Fix floppy emulation warn reboot issue
         b. Fix RAID 0+1 un-sync. flag problem

v0.97    a. Add new option, [Repaire Mirror Conflict]
            It deals with the un-concurrent member lost of Mirror Raid
            Let users choose which hard disk to be source disk,
            The Driver will try to Rebuild by the chosen one
v0.97b   a. fix the bug of v0.97, if you create Raid0+1, then the procedure 
            added in v0.97 forget pop the stack back.

v0.98    a. change the message of <Repair Mirror Conflict>
         b. detect the DF register to modify the amplitude of signle,
            (named it as "Trace_Length" Assembler condition)
         c. detect the Degrade/Rebuild Volume, give a message to users to 
            rebuild the raid in the operation system

v0.98b   a. fixed the side effect of v0.98, when you go into GUI mode. when you choose save 
            the configuration, even do nothing else. The BIOS will clean the partition table.

v0.99a.  a. for Shierly's request,clean the partition table, when "delete raid" or 
            "Revert to Non-Raid". The only exception is that the orignal raid type is Mirror.
            At the past, only when users "Create a Raid", the BIOS will clean the partition
            table. 

            PS. However, I think that it will have confilict in the feature, when we try to make a 
               matrix raid. In my opinion, the Best way is not to do this. Or use the another way to 
               set the degenerate mirror part as a single JBOD raid, however this will cause another 
               problem. The users will see the un-predict Raid Volume. 
               The main cause of this problem to keep the mirror(ever exist) partition table,is that 
               we must to deal with a Raid Volume which not exist now.
         b. added the source code section, to change the sub-vendor ID, sub-device ID
            ,named as "AGENT" Assembler condition
         c. for MSI's issue, go to check the AHCI, if the sata link active. To shorten the detect time.

v0.99b.  a. ifndef JM2S, disable sata port1. This procedure prevent the JM361 to detect the SATA Port 1.

v1.00    a. add function "Rebuild Mirror Drive"
         b. tell the user if the hdd support 3G

v1.01    a. improve the raid disk status update
         b. add function to rebuild Degrade raid disk
         c. to fix the hdd detection issue of JMB360
         d. fix bug of "Solve Mirror Conflict", this problem happen at v1.00

v1.02    a. modify the help message for "Create Raid Drive"
         b. detect register, to switch to IDE/AHCI/RAID mode
         c. added a error message, when Rebuild fail. At last version, if there were error
            at rebuilding process, It will hold on. Now, we pop a window message to tell users 
            the rebuilding not success.

v1.03    a. fix the bug of version 1.02, the <b> item, it not work at version 1.02.
            at version 1.03, it works
         b. for multi-function, jump out of Option ROM, do nothing

v1.04    a. use bit mask to modify the amplitude of signal
         b. solve the problem of external hdd box    >_<
         c. "support 3G" or not, instead of the hard disk work at which level.
            I give an identify device command to get the real hard disk ability.

v1.05    a. for ASUS's request, if bit 4c[4] set, disable PATA RAID
         b. for GIGA-BYTE's request, modify the vendor string, and <ctrl+G>,
            assembler condition is to define GIGABYTE=1
         c. for ASUS's request about JMB360, fix the bug in version 1.03, 1.04

v1.06    At first, there are many difference between v1.05 and v1.06, because GIGABYTE need to swith 
         channel for PATA & SATA channel. It cause that the Option ROM needs to adjust in many place.
         a. fixed bug, dfh register [1:0] write 01h, can not correctly response to IDE mode
         b. if Main BIOS set bit 6 of dfh register, the JMicron controller(361/3/5/6), will switch to
            multi-function, the topology of multi-function is -----
            AHCI in function 0;
            IDE in the function 1; PATA hdd will use Primary channel, SATA HDD will use Secondary channel
         c. defind 4fh register bit [0] to choose channel type
         d. defind 4fh register bit [1] to show/hide message
         e. defind 4fh register bit [3:2] to choose ctrl+j speed
         f. the gigabyte option, just different with other in "GIGABYTE" string
           it is decided by assembler condition.
v1.06.5  a. fix fedoro reboot bug, this issue cause by int13h function 48h
v1.06.51 a. fix udma set furture, this issue may happen in multi-function, in JMB365, JMB366, JMB363
           when this issue happen, will cause hdd maybe not transfer data using udma mode normally,
           however, dma and pio not be affected.

v1.06.53 a. the pata hdd information not display "support 3G:NO" string
         b. if pata mask, Not show "raid 0+1" string
         c. modify default raid name to "GRAID" for GIGABYTE
         d. v1.06.53 already can work in GIGABYTE's mainboard

v1.06.54 a. AHCI mode doesn't show "No-Raid"
         b. when GPIO1=1 can work normally

v1.06.55 a. fix change of the basic unit for driver
         b. address 47h of PCI configuration space, write 0f1h instead of 0f0h (for ASUS ODD)
         c. for JF's request, write 0fh at address 5ah of PCI configuration space, to clean the value
         d. when the controller is not be operated in Raid mode, I still to check the raid structure.
            If there is any raid structure existing. Remind the users.
         e. fix the bug of Rebuilding Mirror Drive
         f. Compact Flash Card boot/access support

1.06.60b a. Disable Sata Port1 at the controller, which not has sata port1
